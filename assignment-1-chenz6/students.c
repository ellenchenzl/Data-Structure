 * This function should initialize a single student struct with name, ID, and
 * GPA data.
 *
 * Params:
 *   student - a pointer to the student struct to be initialized.  The memory
 *     for this student will already be allocated before the function is
 *     called.  You simply need to fill its values.  When the function returns,
 *     the fields of this student struct should contain the corresponding
 *     values passed in the other arguments.  Note that this function must
 *     allocate space for the name field and copy the value from name into the
 *     newly-allocated name field.  Make sure that if any of the fields of
 *     student already have memory on the heap allocated to them, you free that
 *     memory before overwriting it with new values.
 *   name - a string containing the student's name.  Note that you'll have to
 *     make a copy of this string to store in the student struct instead of
 *     storing this string directly.
 *   id - an integer ID for the student
 *   gpa - the student's GPA

 * field in the object being copied, new memory is allocated for a copy of that
 * field to be created, and a pointer to this newly-allocated memory is stored
 * in the copied object.
